    <i
      >Commercial banks receive a lot of applications for credit cards. Many of
      them get rejected for many reasons, like high loan balances, low income
      levels, or too many inquiries on an individual's credit report, for
      example.<br />
      Manually analyzing these applications is mundane, error-prone, and
      time-consuming (and time is money!).<br />
      Luckily, this task can be automated with the power of machine learning and
      pretty much every commercial bank does so nowadays</i
